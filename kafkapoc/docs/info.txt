Notes for Kafka cluster
- the VPC needs to have DNS hostnames enabled for Kafka
- in the TA account the vpc_sandbox VPC has DNS hostnames enabled
- need to have a security group that allows inbound port 9098 and 9094 to cluster

follow these instructions to set up client on ec2 instance (for serverless cluster)

(for normal cluster)

Connecting to FDP
S3
Need to create an OIDC provider in AWS based on information from FDP. This is due to NHS E restriction on creating IAM users in accounts. 
In FDP need to create egress policy to connect to S3 - these appear to need someone in palantir to approve the policy.

Kafka
Need to set up authentication for FDP to be client connecting to Kafka cluster
Need the bootstrap servers details for connection
Need to create an egress policy (similar to S3) to enable FDP to connect  - this appears to need someone in palantir to approve
Unable to create an Agent - not allowed/permissions on my user not correct
