before using cdk need to bootstrap the account to create the relevant S3 bucket.
So for TA AWS account
 - cdk bootstrap aws://865198111306/eu-west-2

create directory "hello-cdk" and then cd hello-cdk

initialise a project based on the "app" template

cdk init app --language typescript

change the information in "lib/hello-cdk-stack.ts"

cdk synth 
to synthesize the cloudformation template

cdk deploy
to deploy the cloudformation stack

cdk diff
to see the difference when you make a change

cdk deploy
again to deploy the changes to the bucket.

finally
cdk destroy
to remove the cloudformation stack and resources.
