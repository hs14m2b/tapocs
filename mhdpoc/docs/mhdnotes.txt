edit the "sut" channel to include the FHIR base for the dummy MHD endpoint
https://internal--mhdpoc-mhdpocbe.nhsdta.com/extapi/FHIR/R4/dummyfhirendpoint

Select the "default" channel and run the "Test_Patients" to initialise first.

the "dummyfhirendpoint" augments the MHD request with org details etc and submits to the NRL sandpit.

The "mhdconverter" app in the NHS Developer accout is set up to connect to the NRL integration environment.
The "test" folder has basic tests to invoke sandpit and int instances of NRL.
