Utility loader for Patient resources that server tests depend on.
Each test listed below controls the loading of a single Patient resource.
Before submitting the Patient to the server, the server is queried and the Patient is only submitted
if it does not exist in that server.  This query uses the given name, family name, and
birthDate parameters.
<br />
<br />
This framework keeps a cache of all Patients loaded and the server they were loaded on. The
server used for Patients can be different from the MHD system under test.
<br />
<br />
These Patient resources are not used for client testing (MHD Document Source for example). Test definitions 
(for servers)
reference Patients through the cache. If the cache is deleted then this Test Collection can be re-run to reload 
the cache.
<br />
<br />
Patients should be loaded using the default channel.  Other channels know to look there for the cached
resources.
