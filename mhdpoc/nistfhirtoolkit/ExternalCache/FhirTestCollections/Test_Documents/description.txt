Utility loader for Binary resources that server tests depend on.
Each test listed below controls the loading of a single Binary resource.
Before submitting the Binary to the server, the server is queried and the Binary is only submitted
if it does not exist in that server.  This query uses a business identifier attached to the Binary.
<br />
<br />
This framework keeps a cache of all Binaries loaded and the server they were loaded on. The
server used for Binaries can be different from the MHD system under test.
<br />
<br />
These Binary resources are not used for client testing (MHD Document Source for example). Test definitions 
(for servers)
reference Binaries through the cache. If the cache is deleted then this Test Collection can be re-run to reload 
the cache.
<br />
<br />
Binaries should be loaded using the default channel.  Other channels know to look there for the cached
resources.
